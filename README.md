Second version of the School System Manager with a few more perks and updated database code.

Navigation menu made with admin-only access in mind, to both view and add employees and students aswell as
search for specific students with the help of an ID to see sensitive information.

Calculate salary payments and medians for different departments and
enroll students in active courses and the possibility to add a grade coded as a transaction.

A few things are currently WIP but will get added eventually.
